# Programming Concepts - Parts of Code

## Variables

A **variable**, as in mathematics, is an unknown quantity. Unknown, that is, at the time you are writing the code. The program will know what value it holds when it actually runs. Although different languages use different conventions for variables, the key idea is always the same – it's a name you use to refer to a piece of data. Setting a variable to a value is called **assigning** the value to the variable. The same data can be assigned to multiple different variables at once. Assigning a new value to a variable replaces any existing one. The rules for what constitutes a valid variable name can vary from language to language.

## Keywords

Programming languages (with some esoteric exceptions) don't just run on numbers and symbols. Some words have a specific meaning to the programming language, called **keywords**. *Which* words are keywords comes down to the language in question, but an important factor to bear in mind is that you usually can't use keywords as names for other things, such as variables, and even if you can you probably shouldn't. Some languages have extensive lists of keywords, and if you accidentally pick one as a variable name you will probably encounter an error. The error may seem unrelated to the code you have written if it's an error generated by how the language expects you to us that keyword.

## Operators

An **operator** in programming terms is very similar to an operator in the mathematical sense. An operator takes one or more inputs and produces an output. The addition symbol, `+`, is an operator. It takes two inputs, one on either side, and produces their sum as its output. The other three rules of arithmetic are also operators, as you would expect, almost universally treated the same by programming languages.

More advanced operations, such as raising a number to a certain power, are unfortunately much less consistent between programming languages.

The exclamation point `!` is often an operator, used to denote negation – i.e. turning True into False and vice versa.

A common mistep involves the equals symbol `=`. In most languages, it's used to *assign* a value to a variable, and if you try to to use it as a test for equality it will either be a syntax error or result in strange behaviour.

## Blocks

Despite what film and TV might have you believe, programming is not a process of typing page after page of closely-written, inpenetrable gobbledegook.
